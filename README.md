# password-generator

Description: 
The password is randomly generated based on criteria that the user provides when prompted.
When the user clicks the button "Generate Password" they are first promoted for a password length. 
If the character count is outside of 8-128 range, then user is prompted to once again enter a password within the range. 
Then the user is asked if they would like to include numbers, characters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. 
When values have been defined, the password will appear inside the password box!
