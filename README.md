# password-generator
Description: The password is randomly generated based on criteria that the user provides when prompted.

When the user clicks the button "Generate Password" they are first promoted for password length. If outside the range of 8-128, the user is prompted to once again enter a password within the range. 

The program then asks the user to if they would like to include numbers, characters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. 

When values have been defined, the password will appear within the password box.
